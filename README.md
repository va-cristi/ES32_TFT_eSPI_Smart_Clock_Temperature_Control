# ES32_TFT_eSPI_Smart_Clock_Temperature_Control

📱 About this repository
Welcome! I am passionate about electronics, especially microcontrollers and modules such as Arduino, ESP32, ESP8266 and many others.
This repository contains various projects and experiments with:

🔧 Modules and sensors
📺 TFT, OLED, character LCD displays (16x2, 20x4, etc.)
⚡ ESP32/ESP8266, Arduino microcontrollers (Uno, R4, Due)
🌡️ Control and monitoring systems

The projects are a combination of:

Personal experiments
Adaptations and improvements of projects found online
Configurations and practical examples
